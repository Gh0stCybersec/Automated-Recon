# Automated-Recon

This script is an attempt at automating some of the first steps for bug bounty hunting.

To use this tool , create a directory for all your targets in the following format. The roots file will contain your chosen subdomains.
```bash
├── 
│   ├── Hackerone
│   │   ├── roots.txt 
│   ├── Bugcrowd
│   │   ├── roots.txt
│   ├── Intigriti
│   │   ├── roots.txt 
```
Recon script will create folders in the same location as roots with the output results.
